# ProgressPal - Smart Lecture Video Progress Tracker

**ProgressPal** is a smart, intuitive, and highly efficient video progress tracking system designed to help students track their progress while watching lecture videos. The system ensures that only genuine watched intervals are counted, skipping doesn't cheat the system, and progress can be saved and resumed accurately. It provides a seamless user experience, allowing students to freely seek through the video while ensuring that only the new watched time is recorded.

## Features

- Smart Progress Tracking: Tracks genuine watched intervals and prevents cheating by skipping.
- Save and Resume Progress: Users can save their progress and resume watching from where they left off.
- Flexible Video Controls: Users can freely seek through the video without losing progress.
- Custom Progress Bar: The UI visually renders watched segments, providing a smooth and intuitive experience.
